# movielens
Capstone project 1 for edx course
This repository contains the first of the two required projects for the 
EDX data science certificate program.
It contains the following FOUR files:
- data_generation.R  This file contains the code that downloads and wrangles the data, that was supplied by the 
  instructor at the beginning. This file generates an R data file called moviedata.RData The data generated by 
  this files is used by the R code that runs the model and the .Rmd file, so it has to be run before.

- movielenseDO.R  File that contains all the coding used to explore the data and build the model. This code uses
  the data file moviedata.RData generated by the file data_generation.R
  
- MovielenseDO.Rmd File File that contains the report with all the code necessary to run the model. This file loads
  the datafile moviedata.RData, it must be generated by the file data_genration.R
  
- MovielenseDO.pdf resulting from the rendering of the Movielense.Rmd file. Note that not all the code included in 
  the .Rmd file is shown in the pdf.
