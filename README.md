# movielens
Capstone project 1 for edx course
This repository contains the first of the two required projects for the 
EDX data science certificate program.
It contains the following three files:
- movielenseDO.R  File that contains all the coding used to download andexplore the data and build the model. Lines
427 to 482 (finding number of knots for splines moddels) contain 2 loops that take about one hour to complete each. 
The model fit in line 486 has the parameters obtained from the loops included, in case the person evaluating the project wishes
to run the file faster by skipping those lines. 
  
- projectDO.Rmd File File that contains the report with all the code necessary to run the model, including the 
download of the data.
  
- projectDO.pdf resulting from the rendering of the Movielense.Rmd file. Note that not all the code included in 
  the .Rmd file is shown in the pdf.
